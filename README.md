Beginner-level playful Python scripts created while learning

## 🐱 cat_mood_translator.py

A 100% accurate AI-based system (ok, not really) for decoding your cat’s emotional states based on vague inputs.

The next two are potentially useful but more me just practicing searching for substrings

# 🕵️‍♀️ number_detective

This tiny detective loops through 0–9 and checks if *any* of those sneaky digits are hiding in your string.  
If it finds one, it shouts with joy.  
If it finds nothing, it solemnly declares: “No digits found.”

# 🔍 vowel_scanner

Scans your input word for the presence of the elite vowel squad: a, e, i, o, u.  
Each vowel is interrogated. If it's present, you'll know. If it's not, you'll *still* know.  
Finishes with a dramatic “Scan complete.”
